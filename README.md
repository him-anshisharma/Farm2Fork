# Farm2Fork

## Project Description

Farm2Fork is a revolutionary blockchain-based supply chain management system designed specifically for the agricultural industry. Built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts, this platform provides complete transparency and traceability of agricultural products from the moment they are planted until they reach the consumer's table.

The system addresses critical challenges in food supply chain management including food fraud, contamination tracking, authenticity verification, and consumer trust. By leveraging blockchain technology's immutable nature, Farm2Fork ensures that every step in the agricultural supply chain is recorded, verified, and publicly accessible while maintaining the integrity of the data.

Key stakeholders including farmers, processors, distributors, retailers, and consumers can interact with the platform to register products, update status, verify authenticity, and track the complete journey of agricultural products. The smart contract enforces business rules, validates transitions, and maintains a comprehensive audit trail for regulatory compliance and consumer confidence.
